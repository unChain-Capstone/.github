  <i>UnChain: AI-Based Application for Tackling Sugar Addiction with Integrated Chatbot</i>
</div>




### EXCUTIVE SUMMARY
The global prevalence of diabetes has reached 537 million individuals as reported by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2021, with projections indicating an increase to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045. These statistics raise significant public health concerns, particularly given that diabetes mellitus is frequently referred to as the mother of all diseases.

### OUR CONCERN
It is alarming that many street foods and market products lack clear labeling regarding their sugar content, which contributes to a widespread unawareness of sugar intake. This issue is particularly concerning given that the impact of diabetes does not seem to receive adequate attention from the public. For instance, there is a high prevalence of high-sugar items showcased on platforms like TikTok, such as martabak loaded with toppings and dubai chocolate, which further normalizes excessive sugar consumption. Consequently, there is a pressing need for an accessible application in Indonesia that makes it easier for individuals to track their sugar intake and promote healthier eating habits.

### OBJECTIVE
Develop a mobile application to help users understand, track, and reduce sugar addiction.

Project Scope:
- Build a mobile application to help users break free from various addictions.
- The application can detect and track user's addiction patterns using Machine Learning and integrated with AI-Assistant Chatbot.
- The application initially focuses on sugar addiction due to the prototype development timeline.
  
Deliverables:
- Users can use this application to : 
- Track and monitor their addiction patterns
- Learn about addiction mechanisms and recovery strategies
- Get real-time support and progress monitoring
